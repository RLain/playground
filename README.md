## Rebecca's Playground

Welcome to my playground. Here lies random things I am testing. 🤓 To run things, select the code
then use the CTRL + CMD + N command to execute.

### Some things I am playing around with:

`axios`

Understanding promise responses and error handling when using the axios HTTP client.

URL: https://axios-http.com/docs/intro

`fetch`

Understanding promise responses and error handling when using fetch.
https://javascript.info/fetch-api

#### Notable things:

1. then/catch returns undefined with axios and [object Promise] with fetch
2. try/catch returns [object Promise] for both axios and fetch
3. The error responses from axios vs fetch are very different. Axios's seems better, more detailed and easier to access values.
4. fetch does not consider server side issues as errors! BIG difference to axios. Custom function is required to turn 4XX and 5XX into errors.
